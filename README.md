# poker-counting-tool
Simple web application to help you keep track of four player's bets and totals for games of poker.

## Todo
While it works for four players, I'd like to change the following:

- [ ]  Add an "add player"-button, as well as maybe a "remove player" button
- [ ]  Make the default bet adjustable, rather than  just 20
- [ ]  Ideally, there should be something to make it more visible which players folded
